# epsilon.f90 modified version

Here we present a modified version of Quantum Espresso's `epsilon.f90` code. 

We changed the original Fortan code to print additional information about the Transition Dipole Moment resolved in the `k-points`, `initial`, and `final` Khom-Sham one-electron states.

# `TODO` write the tutorial on how to use this code, describing how to compile it as a part of Quantum Espresso.
